# HTTP

## Communication Layer

1. Physical Layer e.g. Modems, Twisted Pair
2. ...

## IPv4

offsets, packets, data

IPv4 vs IPv6, size of address spaces

## TCP & UDP

Transmittion Control Protocol

Core Protocol

Provide reliable, ordered communication

### UDP

faster, no guaranteed delivery, voip....

### DNS

Domain Name System

- IP address not sufficient
- Not human friendly

Each computer knows IP of at least one DNS server
If DNS server does not know the IP, it will ask another DNS server

## HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

### Versions

- HTTP/0.9  1991 (GET only)
- HTTP/1.0  1996 (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE)
- HTTP/1.1  1997 (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT)
- HTTP/2    2015 (GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT, PATCH)
- HTTP/3    2022 QUIC

#### HTTP/1 - 1996

Request == create TCP connection

#### HTTP/1.1 - 1997

- "Keep-Alive" == reuse TCP connection
  - Speed up

- "Pipelining" == send multiple requests without waiting for response
  - Receive multiple request in same order

Problems

- "Head-of-line blocking" == slowest request determines the speed of the whole request
- "Slowloris" == DoS attack
- Proxies couldn't cache responses

#### HTTP/2 - 2015

- "Stream Multiplexing" == send multiple requests without waiting for response
  - Receive multiple request in same order
  - Speed up

- "Server Push" == server can send multiple responses without waiting for request

- "Header Compression" == reduce size of headers

#### HTTP/3 - 2022

Explosive growth of the Internet and mobile users,

Google's QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection) protocol is a new transport protocol that aims to improve the speed and reliability of web browsing.

Allow switching networks without losing connection (WiFi, 4G, 5G, etc.) by add `connection-id` to the header, and in different connection, the `connection-id` is same.

## HTTP Communication

### HEAD

- GET without body
- Only header (metadata)

### GET

- Most common
- Request a representation of the specified resource
- Should not be used for operations that cause side effects

### POST

- Submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- Data is the body of the request.

### PUT

- Upload a representation of the specified resource

### Delete

- Delete the specified resource

### TRACE

- Echos the received request so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers

### OPTIONS

- Return the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL
- Check functionality of a web server (by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource)

### CONNECT

- Establish a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource

## Idempotent and Safe

### Idempotent

Don't change the state of the server

### Safe

Can be cachede
