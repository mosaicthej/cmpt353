# Web Programming

## Basic Principles

### Client-Server Architecture (Request-Response)

### Uniform Interface

- Naming (URI/URL)
- verbs/actions (HTTP methods)
    unlike OOP, the methods are limited to a few (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    1. *POST*
    2. *GET*
    3. *PUT/PATCH*
    4. *DELETE*
- Stateless: the server does not store any information about the client, and the client does not store any information about the server.

## Full Stack Web Development

### Full stack software development

- Front-end: the part of the application that the user interacts with
- Back-end: part that the server interacts with

#### Front-end

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- WebAssembly
- Frameworks: *React*, *Angular*, *Vue*, etc.

#### Back-end

- Node.js
- Server Patterns: *MVC*, *MVVM*, etc.
- N Tier Architecture
- SQL vs NoSQL
- Cloud Computing: *AWS*, *Azure*, *GCP*, etc.
    1. Cost ability
    2. Scalability
- Frameworks: *Express*, *Django*, *Flask*, etc.
